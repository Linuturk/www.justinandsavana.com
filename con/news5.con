<p>I'm finally getting my wedding dress altered tomorrow! I'm so excited and nervous and stressed, but mostly excited. :) Don't worry, I will take pictures of me in my wedding gown after the alterations to share with anyone who <a href="mailto:slc04c@gmail.com">emails</a> me and asks for them. I can't post them here or Justin will see. We can't have any bad omens this close to the wedding! Thank you to everyone who has been leaving such wonderful comments in our <a href="gallery.php">gallery</a>. All of you are so sweet! Also, thank you to everyone who has sent emails in congratulations. Justin and I are so blessed to have such great friends and family. Please don't forget to <a href="news.php#news3">RSVP</a> online or snail mail if haven't already. One last thing, we're planning our reception menus. If you have a favorite snack food please let us know! Thanks everyone!</p>
