<p>We've been really busy here lately, working on the wedding and doing a lot of travel. For those that don't know, the previous announcement was an <strong>April Fool's Joke.</strong> I hope everyone got a good chuckle out of our mischief.</p>
<p>The wedding is right around the corner, and things seem to be shaping up really nice, thanks to the wonderful help we have been receiving from our families. We went to the courthouse yesterday and picked up our wedding license as well.</p>
<p>We'll be back in Milton this coming weekend to finalize a lot of the preparations. Then it's back for a few day of work before we head back to Milton Wednesday night.</p>
<p>As you can see on the calendar, we are setup for a few busy days before the wedding. The rehearsal dinner is on Thursday at 3:30 PM, and we'll be decorating the church afterwards. Friday, Trent and Jarod will be preparing the food, and all the loose ends will be tied up.</p>
<p>We hope to see everyone at the wedding, and don't forget to take a look at our <a href="registry.php">Registry Page</a> for gift ideas!</p>
