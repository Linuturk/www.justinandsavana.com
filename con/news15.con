<p>A lot has happened since the site was last updated way back in July. We have since moved to Panama City, FL. I have started a new job, and Savana has started staying home more to take care of the house and pets. I just restored the site from a backup we took before the move, but I don't have a copy of the database. That means that the gallery and comment system are down until I can restore that functionality.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The gallery has been fixed. Enjoy.</p>
