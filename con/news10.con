<p>We are going to be blessed with a baby in approximately 8 months! It is quite unexpected, and we are both nervous, but it is a welcome event none the less. Even though we don't know the gender of the baby, please leave any name suggestions in the comments below. We have our fingers crossed for a girl :)</p>

<p>We'll now be using the Wishing Well at the reception as a Baby Well to help celebrate. We will schedule a Baby Shower and post it here. It will be sometime after the Wedding, and we hope you can attend.</p>
<p>Until then, here is a nice baby name website to give you ideas! <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=april+fools" target="_blank">Babynames.com</a> We are both very happy, and hope you share in our Joy! :)</p>
