<p>Savana and I (with tons of help from our family) spent a long time planning the wedding. Over a year of planning and preparation went into the ceremony, and it surprised us both when everything seemed over in about 15 minutes! The whole experience seemed surreal.</p>
<p>We both want to thank everyone for coming, and for the wonderful gifts. We had an excellent honeymoon thanks to you. We would also like to thank everyone who helped us prepare the church and organize the event. We would like to thank the church for hosting the event, and we would especially like to thank Charlie Bradshaw for performing the ceremony.</p>
<p>A spam bot has started spamming the comment system, so I've had to turn it off. I'll see about sorting that out, and maybe we'll get the comment system back up. Also, keep an eye out on our Photo Gallery for honeymoon and wedding photos. We'll be posting them as they are developed.</p>
