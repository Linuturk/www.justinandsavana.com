<p>If you have been paying attention to the calendar, you already know the invitations are going out today. Thanks to a 4 hour printing and stuffing session last night, everyone will get their invitation and RSVP card on time. Please be sure to RSVP so we know you are coming!</p>
<p>If the old snail mail method of RSVP doesn't suite your fancy, I've setup a digital RSVP below. Be sure to tell us who you are and how many total guests are coming (including yourself!)</p>
