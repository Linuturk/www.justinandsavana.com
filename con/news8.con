<p>A big thank you to everyone who came to our wedding shower Saturday. It was a wonderful event, and we also want to thank Savana's mother and sister for organizing the event.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed the party games, and the chocolate cake. You can also find the music videos online on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/hakugaara" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>
